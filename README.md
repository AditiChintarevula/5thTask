### Basic Calculator Application
## Description
This project is a basic calculator application that can perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is built using React, and styled with CSS for a user-friendly interface.

## Implementation
# 1. React Components
The application consists of the following React components:

# Calculator: The main component that holds the interface and the logic.
NumberButton: A reusable component for each number button.
OperationButton: A reusable component for each operation button.
# 2. State Management
React's useState hook is used to manage the input and output of the calculator. The state is updated based on user interactions.

# 3. Event Handlers
Event handlers are implemented for button clicks to update the input values and perform the necessary calculations. These handlers ensure that the correct operations are performed based on the user's input.

# 4. Styling
The calculator is styled using CSS to provide a clean and intuitive user interface.
